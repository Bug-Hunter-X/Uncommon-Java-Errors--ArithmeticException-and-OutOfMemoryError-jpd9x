This repository contains a Java program that showcases two types of errors that might be less frequently encountered compared to common exceptions like NullPointerException or IllegalArgumentException. The first is an ArithmeticException resulting from division by zero. The second is a potential OutOfMemoryError due to excessive memory allocation.  The included solution demonstrates proper handling of the ArithmeticException and provides a suggestion to avoid the OutOfMemoryError.
